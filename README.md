# Rik Brown

## Founding Software Engineer at District

I build applications with React, Typescript, Tailwind, GraphQL, AWS, etc for [District](https://www.district.net). In a past life, I was the lead engineer for telemetry at Snap(chat) on Web and Android. Before that, I made self-driving grocery stores scale at [Amazon Go](https://www.amazon.com/b?ie=UTF8&node=16008589011) - and annoyed you by building DRM for Prime Video.

Passionate about exploring new languages and tools, being data driven, and ultimately changing the world. (Or maybe just building cool new stuff).

### Hi there 👋
